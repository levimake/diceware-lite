        <h3> What is Diceware ? </h3>
        <p class="box-text">Dicewareâ„¢ is a method for picking passphrases that uses dice to select words at random from a special list called the Diceware Word List. Each word in the list is preceded by a five digit number. All the digits are between one and six, allowing you to use the outcomes of five dice rolls to select a word from the list.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="box">
        <h3>Using Diceware Lite</h3>
        <p class="box-text">For creating diceware passwords, you need one dice or more (preferably 5). Since dice are cheap, 5 is better. Now follow the steps for creating a diceware pass-phrase.</p>
        <ol type="1" style="margin-bottom:20px;">
            <li> Go to the Settings from menu drawer.</li>
            <li>Choose the desired number of words required for your passphrase.</li>
            <li>Choose the language in which your pass phrase should be created and set the source to dice.</li>
            <li>Start rolling your dice and tap the dice face on the screen with the value you got when rolling your die.</li>
            <li>You are shown with the password when the required rolls are completed. </li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <h3>Extra Stuff</h3>
        <p class="box-text">While creating your passphrase, if you feel some words are really short, you can remove them simply by pressing the close button and then try for another word. The app also supports generating password using your device's Pseudo Random Number Generator (PRNG) and random.org. PRNG is insecure and Random.org recommends that they could not be used for cryptographic purposes. So it is always better to use the dice while creating your pass-phrase and don't be lazy in being secure. Better try to make one when you have time.</p>
